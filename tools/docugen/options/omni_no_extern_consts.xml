  <Name>OMNI_NO_EXTERN_CONSTS</Name>
  <Brief>If defined, Omni constants will not have external linkage</Brief>
  <Considerations>Know that you are changing the linkage from static to extern with regards to the constant values in the library.</Considerations>
  <Description>The constant string values in the library are marked @c extern as their default linkage. To change this behaviour to have all string constants be marked as @c static instead of @c extern you can define this macro option, there's no additional files to exclude as this flag disables portions of the code that pertain to the extern values.</Description>
  <Notes>The extern'd values reside in @h library.cpp @h (which is always built with the library, but if the macro is enabled, the extern portions are not compiled in).</Notes>
  <PlatformSpecific>No platform specific notes.</PlatformSpecific>
  <Synopsis>If this macro is defined, the constants within the library will not be extern'd and instead will exist as const values in the headers to be included.</Synopsis>
