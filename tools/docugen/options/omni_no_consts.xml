  <Name>OMNI_NO_CONSTS</Name>
  <Brief>Disables any library defined constants.</Brief>
  <Considerations>If this is macro is defined, any constants will be undefined and you must use their macro equivlents instead.</Considerations>
  <Description>If this macro is enabled/defined, this will disable any constants defined in namespaces or classes. For example, instead of using the constant omni::math::PI in a funciton, you would have to utilize the OMNI_PI macro. This is in the rare event that the size of an executable should be taken into account; defining this compile time option will slightly reduce the overall size of the library code.</Description>
  <Notes>This does not disable any @c const values in local functions, it only disables the library constants.</Notes>
  <PlatformSpecific>No platform specific notes.</PlatformSpecific>
  <Synopsis>Defining this macro will have the effect of having any library specific constants be undefined.</Synopsis>
