  <Name>OMNI_APLNL</Name>
  <Brief>If defined, uses the \r new line instead of \n.</Brief>
  <Considerations>No special consideration.</Considerations>
  <Description>Most Unix and Linux platforms use the \n as a new line character while Windows platforms will use \r\n to mean 'new line'; Apple platforms are typically Unix based and will adhere to the de-facto \n new line constant (at least will honor it as a new line), but some platforms will use the \r (form feed) character to mean a new line. If you are targeting a platform (some older Apple platforms for instance), that use the \r to mean newline, define this option and the OMNI_NEW_LINE macro will be a \r instead the default for the platform (\r\n for Windows and \n for all others).</Description>
  <Notes>None.</Notes>
  <PlatformSpecific>This option is only valid on non Windows platforms. If you wish to force the OMNI_NEW_LINE macro to be \r for all platforms, then you must define OMNI_NEW_LINE as \r in your compilation options (e.g. via /DOMNI_NEW_LINE=\r)</PlatformSpecific>
  <Synopsis>The OMNI_NEW_LINE macro is defined as \r\n on Windows platforms and \n on all other detected platforms (via certain platform specific macro definitions). If the OMNNI_APLNL macro is defined, then the default \n newline character will instead be \r.</Synopsis>
