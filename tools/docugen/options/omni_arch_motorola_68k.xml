  <Name>OMNI_ARCH_MOTOROLA_68K</Name>
  <Brief>Defines a Motorola 68k processor architecture was detected.</Brief>
  <Considerations>Architecture detection via preprocessor flags is not always guaranteed as they can be explicitly defined by a user. Take care when relying on these macros to determine architecture specifics.</Considerations>
  <Description>None.</Description>
  <Notes>None.</Notes>
  <PlatformSpecific>No special consideration.</PlatformSpecific>
  <Synopsis>If compilation happens on an architecture (or with a compiler) with certain preprocessor flags, this macro is defined.

See @h omni/defs/arch.hpp @h for which flags enable this option.</Synopsis>
