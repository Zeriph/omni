  <Brief>A helper macro for millisecond sleeps</Brief>
  <Considerations>While the sleep specified is meant for 1ms sleep, it can be typical for a sleep to take approximately 10-15ms due to @_time slicing and kernel timing. So a 1ms sleep might be 1ms, 10ms or even 0 (i.e. no sleep).</Considerations>
  <Description>To enable millisecond sleep capabilities cross-platform, temporaries are needed on non-Windows platforms; to this, when omni::sync::sleep is called, this macro is utilized. As well, in other areas of the library where a sleep is called in a tight loop, this macro is utilized.

Example:

@code
OMNI_SLEEP_INIT();
while (dorun) {
    OMNI_SLEEP1(); // ~1ms sleep
}
@code

In this example, OMNI_SLEEP_INIT is an empty macro on Windows platforms and the sleep variables needed on others and OMNI_SLEEP expands to the Windows Sleep function and the nanosleep function on others to achieve millisecond sleep resolution.
