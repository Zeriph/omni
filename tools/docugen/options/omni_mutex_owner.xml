  <Brief>Sets the omni::sync::mutex to keep track of owning thread.

  <Considerations>No special considerations

  <Description>It's is undefined behavior for a thread that does not own the mutex to unlock it. If an unlock is called in such a manner, the application is likely to crash; to be able to catch this, defining this macro will add an omni::sync::thread_t to the mutex object to keep track of which thread called it (i.e. which thread owns the lock).

  <Synopsis>If this macro is defined, the omni::sync::mutex will maintain track of the calling/owning thread.
