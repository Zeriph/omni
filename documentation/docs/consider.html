While building, deploying, and working with Omni you might experience certain issues that would initially appear
to be a bug with the library code, when it is actually either an erroneous compiler error message or you might not have 
<a href="build/index.html">built</a> and referenced Omni in the same way (as examples). To help with any errors or issues you
might run into, we've compiled a quasi Q&amp;A of developer notes and issues to consider when using the library.
This list is not a comprehensive list of known issues and does not cover topics that might be in the
<a href="classes/index.html">class documentation</a>, this list is meant more as a developer commentary on issues or
other considerations to take note of while using Omni.<br><br>
If you feel an issue is indeed a bug, please <a href="mailto:omniqa@zeriph.com">email</a> or
<a href="https://zeriph.com/contact.php">contact us</a> to let us know so we can resolve the issue.<br><br>

Documentation light/dark theme
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
To change the color theme of the offline documentation, change the first line of the main CSS file (located under
'content/main.css') from `@import url("themes/dark.css");` to `@import url("themes/light.css");` or vice versa
to change between a dark and light color theme.

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_padding" name="issue_padding" />
<label class="code" for="issue_padding"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Struct/class padding
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Considerable effort and care has been put into the classes and structures being properly aligned
to byte boundaries to reduce padding, and to ideally have 0 padding. If you compile Omni with other
options, like adding the <code>name</code> or <code>disposing</code> members to any class, the padding
for that class/struct could be misaligned and thus the compiler will add padding. As well, if you are running
on a 32-bit system, you can specify the <a href="options/omni_32bit.html">OMNI_32BIT</a> preprocessor
flag to have certain classes compile with 32-bit integer types to reduce or get rid of padding.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
If padding and alignment are of concern, be aware that you can specify the <a href="options/omni_32bit.html">OMNI_32BIT</a> flag
for the entire library or individual classes.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_intbool" name="issue_intbool" />
<label class="code" for="issue_intbool"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Integer types utilized as boolean values
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Due to the underlying types utilized in a lot of the classes, as they are not simple types that could be represented as bit fields,
a lot of the classes utilize an integer type that is bit mapped against constant values, versus utilizing numerous boolean fields.
In doing this, the library can be more memory and runtime efficient since the class is memory aligned.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
No resolution is needed, but it should be understood regarding the padding and alignment of the classes. For more information,
refer to the issue above regarding struct/class padding.

<label class="code" for="issue_vthunk"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Virtual thunk error/crash
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
A virtual thunk has to do with how the underlying class pointers are built.
A virtual thunk can occur when you build the library as a static or dynamic library to link against
(e.g. <code>.lib</code>/<code>.a</code>) with an option such as <a href="options/omni_type_info.html">OMNI_TYPE_INFO</a>,
and then build your project, referencing the library and associated headers, <i><b>without</b></i> using OMNI_TYPE_INFO.
The error occurs because the library source will have the extra members built into it, but the headers referenced in your
source will not, thus causing incongruities between your source binary and the library binary.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
Ensure you build your projects with the same build parameters as you supplied to build the library
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_siof" name="issue_siof" />
<label class="code" for="issue_siof"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Static initialization order fiasco
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Some functionality of the library would fall pray to the initialization of static objects before
other static objects were properly initialized, or what is commonly refered to as the <i>static initialization
order fiasco</i>. To this, a few areas of the code will claim heap memory (like the thread management functions)
for their static objects via the <code>new</code> keyword. However, they do <i>not</i> call <code>delete</code>
since they are not reference-aware types and do not need to be freed unless the program ends, thus these objects
will remain for the lifetime of the program. This would be true even if new/delete were not called, so there is
not a memory leak in the sense that there is no <code>delete</code> for a call to <code>new</code>.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
None, just be aware that some areas of code had to be designed a certain way to overcome certain constructs within
the C++ language; while some of these limitations are not necessarily an issue in newer versions of the C++
language, Omni does aim to be compatible with C++98 and above, so this must be taken into consideration for older
platforms or compilers.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_trunc" name="issue_trunc" />
<label class="code" for="issue_trunc"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Certain areas of the library may result in truncation of the output based on input type.
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Many areas of the library utilize templates or return values that could truncate the output of the floating point
value. For example, calling <code>omni::math::point_on_circle</code> with a template type that is not a floating
point type could give a result that is not precise due to integer conversion and truncation.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
Ensure you understand the precision of the types you are using in templated functions or explicitly define
that the function use a floating point type.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_smartptr" name="issue_smartptr" />
<label class="code" for="issue_smartptr"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Use of any <code>smart_ptr</code> types to any array pointer will not call <code>delete[]</code>
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
The use of any <code>omni::smart_ptr</code> types that are templated to an array pointer will not call
<code>delete[]</code>. In other words, if you create an <code>omni::smart_ptr&lt;obj[]&gt;</code>, when the underlying
object held by the <code>smart_ptr</code> is no longer needed, it will call the non-array <code>delete</code> on
the object and not all objects in the array will be properly freed. Instead you will need to use a
<code>smart_ptr&lt;obj*&gt;</code>. If you want a smart pointer type that references a contiguous array type, you
will need to use an STL container instead, like a <code>std::vector&lt;obj&gt;</code> or <code>std::deque&lt;obj&gt;</code>;
for example: <code>omni::smart_prt&lt;std::vector&lt;obj&gt;&gt;</code>.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
Ensure you do not use improper array types when using a smart pointer type and read the documentation to ensure
the limitations and use cases of the Omni library type being used.

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_exlibs" name="issue_exlibs" />
<label class="code" for="issue_exlibs"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
External system libraries
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Some systems might need external system libraries to link properly. For instance, when compiling on certain
BSD based systems, <i>-pthread</i> had to be passed to all of the platforms to make use of the threading facilities
in the library (via the POSIX thread library), while <i>-rt</i> only had to be passed to some to make use of the
real-time system libraries for the timer facilities of the library.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
Ensure you link against the correct system libraries when building.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_wordexp" name="issue_wordexp" />
<label class="code" for="issue_wordexp"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
GLIBC wordexp
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Some platforms do not implement the GLIBC wordexp (like OpenBSD) for many security reasons.
As such, it is not really a good idea to call the
<a href="classes/omni@5Fenvironment@5Fexpand@405Fvars.html">omni::environment::expand_vars</a> function
without validating the user input; it is there for a convenience function. You can define
the <a href="options/omni_env_wordexp.html">OMNI_ENV_WORDEXP</a> compile flag to use wordexp
on systems that support it, but it is still generally a good idea to validate user input.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
This is not a bug but could potentially lead to unintended consequences.

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_compwarn" name="issue_compwarn" />
<label class="code" for="issue_compwarn"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Compiler warnings
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
As with any code, it is generally not a good idea to ignore any warnings generated by your compiler.
There are some, however, that can be safely ignored once you deduce their true meaning. To this, you
might see some warning about old-style casts, or unused references; it is important to note <i>where</i>
these warnings are coming from, that is, is the warning coming from the library source itself, or a
system header used on a particular platform.<br>
<br>
As an example, when compiling on certain systems, you might get a warning about an old-style cast
in application.cpp with reference to SIG_ERR. This is because SIG_ERR might be<br><br>
#define SIG_ERR (void (*)(int))-1
<br><br>
Which <i>is</i> an old-style cast, though not an explicit error to be necessarily concerned with.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
None; compiler warnings should always be investigated.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_compwarnx" name="issue_compwarnx" />
<label class="code" for="issue_compwarnx"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
Compiler warnings continued
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Enabling certain compiler warnings might yield a warning similar to the following:<br><br>
'b_val' should be initialized in the member initialization list<br><br>
However, it is an error to initialize multiple members of a union:<br><br>
error: initializations for multiple members<br>
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
Heed the error and ignore the warning.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_nonport" name="issue_nonport" />
<label class="code" for="issue_nonport"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
<a href="options/omni_non_portable.html">OMNI_NON_PORTABLE</a>
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Use of non-portable code can not be portably guaranteed. What that means is that the function
used within a block of OMNI_NON_PORTABLE code might not work on all systems, or if it does work
you might get varied results from the different platforms. 
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
None, just be aware of what the OMNI_NON_PORTABLE flag is.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_winapi" name="issue_winapi" />
<label class="code" for="issue_winapi"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
<a href="options/omni_no_win_api.html">OMNI_NO_WIN_API</a>
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
As detailed in other sections of the help documentation, if the <a href="options/omni_win_api.html">OMNI_WIN_API</a> flag
is not enabled, that is, you are electing to use the CRT vs. Windows API calls, some
functionality will remain as WinAPI calls.<br><br>
For instance, there is no CRT equivalent to the WinAPI GetModuleFileName and thus OMNI_NO_WIN_API is not applicable.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
None. This is not a bug but an implementation detail.
</td></tr></table></div>

<div class="consider"><input type="checkbox" id="issue_oseqt" name="issue_oseqt" />
<label class="code" for="issue_oseqt"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
<a href="options/omni_seq_t.html">OMNI_SEQ_T</a>
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
This <code>#define</code> value is a helper function used throughout the library
in place of using a specific C++ sequence container (like the <code>std::vector</code> or the <code>std::deque</code>).<br>
<br>
As explained in the help docs, this helper macro is designed to allow a developer the choice of
which STL sequence container they might want the library to use. Since it is an STL container, we
could not use a simple typedef to define a new type, and we can not use the C++11 using directive (without
the <a href="options/omni_enable_cxx.html">OMNI_ENABLE_CXX</a>) to alias the types due to the
varying compiler support. To avoid the use/overuse of macros we had considered giving an interface to
the defined STL via an overridden class, example:
<pre>
namespace omni {
    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    public class seq_t : public virtual OMNI_SEQ_T&lt;T&gt; {};
}
</pre>
But this presented another set of issues and challenges to be aware of. To this, we have decided
to keep this functionality at the macro level for simplicities sake (and because there are not
a lot of areas in the code that make use of this feature).
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
This is not a bug, but something to be aware of when using the library; considerations
are being made for other variations on this issue, should something more clear come along.

DEV_NOTE
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Throughout the code you might see a comment with a <i>DEV_NOTE</i> tag to it. These notes are
specific to that area of code and are reminders as to why a section of code is
the way it is or as a note of platform issues to be aware of.

None, these are developer notes throughout the source.

.hxx/.cxx files
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
The library has certain files that contain implementation code for certain classes.
The code is separated this way for easier reading and debugging but the files are not meant to be included
directly in any user code nor are they intended to be compiled directly, otherwise erroneous errors
might appear during compilation.
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
This is not a bug, but be aware the source files ending in .cxx or .hxx are not meant to be included
or compiled directly by any user code.

<label class="code" for="issue_honly"> details</label><table class="code"><tr>
<td>Issue</td><td>
No header only library
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
The Omni library contains header files and translation units (.cpp files) which must be built in to object files and
subsequently assembled into a library file that can be linked against (or compiled into your binary). This is by design,
that is, it is a design decision to have Omni <i>not</i> be a header only library for many reasons (name collision, static
instances and extern members to name a few).
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
Portions of the library are indeed header only, like some of the chrono features, as such these portions of code
do not need to be compiled separately as long as there are not extra dependencies on code that does need to be
compiled separately.<br><br>
The library <i>is</i>, however, designed to be compiled via one translation unit. So to build the entire
library in one file, you could simply build <a href="htmlsrc/library.cpp.html">library.cpp</a> while referencing
the source path as an include path, example:<br><br>
Apple/*nix (using g++): g++ /source/your_code.cpp /source/omni/library.cpp -I/source/omni<br>
Windows (using VS): cl C:\source\your_code.cpp C:\source\omni\library.cpp /IC:\source\omni<br><br>
That will build your_code.cpp along with the Omni library as one executable binary.

std::swap
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
Certain classes throughout the library allow you to swap 2 objects and their underlying data via that classes <code>swap</code>
method. Each of these classes will have a local swap method specific to the class, as well as override std::swap 
(in the header that defines the class) to call the classes swap method.<br><br>
Overriding std::swap, while providing a class method swap as well, allows a developer to worry less that the proper swap
is called if they simply did <i>swap(t1, t2)</i> or if they indeed chose to explicitly call <i>std::swap(t1, t2)</i>
(where t1 and t2 are types from the library).
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
None, just be aware that if a class provides a swap method, calling std::swap <i>will</i> call that method.

Standard integer types used through out the library
</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>
The library will use standard integer types (e.g. int32_t) in any and all places that make sense. However there are a
few exceptions, like omni::application::run, that take or return a non-standarized type (like a plain <i>int</i> or
<i>long</i>). This is becuase those portions are intended to be utilized with standards compliant functions (like
<i>int main(int argc, char* argv[])</i>) or make use of specific platform API's that take non-standardized types
for their input (e.g. a WinAPI taking a DWORD).
</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>
None, just be sure to read the documenation and be aware of the few spots in the library that take or return
a non-standardized integer type.

Some examples throughout the documentation might, in some cases, be somewhat verbose in their content.
For example, one might see a line like the following:<br><br>
<code>std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;val[&quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot;]: &quot; &lt;&lt; val[x] &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code><br><br>
and while this line most certainly can be <code>auto</code>'d or put in a macro or function, the point of the examples
is to showcase how to utilize certain functionality of the library. To that, making some of the examples less verbose
by adding macros or certain functions might actually add more confusion to the example itself and defeat the purpose
of said example.<br>
