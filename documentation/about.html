<div class="ptitle"><a name="what_is_omni"></a>Omni - A C++ Library</div><div class="content"><div>
<font class="hdr">What is Omni?</font><br>
Omni is an object oriented, cross-platform C++ library, with recognizable paradigms like
<a href="docs/examples/threading.html">thread objects</a>, <a href="docs/examples/delegates_and_events.html">delegates and events</a>, 
and easy to understand <a href="docs/classes/index.html">interfaces</a>, Omni enables you to get clean and
stable C++ code to a wider market more efficiently while lowering code maintenance costs.<br><br>
The library is C++98 compliant<sup><a href="#supone">1</a></sup> using <a href="docs/api.html">platform API's</a> where
the <a href="docs/api.html#system_api_std">C++ STL or standard library</a> can not accommodate<sup><a href="#suptwo">2</a></sup>
and allows a developer the ability to customize the library to their needs. Omni is built and tested to have compatibility on
a wide array of <a href="xplat.html">platforms</a> and is designed to be compilable <i>"out of the box"</i>, that is, after a
fresh install of an OS and compiler there is nothing extra to setup or install<sup><a href="#supthree">3</a></sup>; just reference
the latest <a href="files/src.zip">source</a> in your <a href="docs/build/index.html">build parameters</a> and compile!<br><br>

Omni is more than a framework, it is a library of classes and procedures designed to have easy to read structures and give a 
functional and reusable tool set with less bloat. On top of the various <a href="docs/build/index.html">build parameters</a>,
you do not need to compile the entire library and can elect to use the portions of the library you want, leaving the portions
you do not. And with its <a href="license.txt">open</a> design, a developer has the option to build or edit the library to
their specific needs. This gives the developer a more flexible library to utilize and work with.<br><br>

Omni aims to make the complex and unique challenges of C++ software development simple and intuitive.<br><br>

<font class="hdr">What is the goal?</font><br>
There are many goals Omni aims for, from simple designs to standards compliance. But one of the major goals of Omni is
deterministic behaviour across platforms and compilers.<br><br>
A compiler can choose to do what it might want at an assembly level to build a binary but it must conform to the C++ standard
if it is to be C++ compliant. As such, while the compilers we built and tested against do indeed build conformant code,
some (particularly older compilers) had issues with implicitness on certain classes. So while
<code>std::bitset&lt;8&gt;(42).to_string()</code> might build without error on one compiler, another could complain about the
<code>to_string</code> function; to which we had to adjust the code to read
<code>std::bitset&lt;8&gt;(42).to_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;()</code>.<br><br>
Similarly, certain platform specific functionality (like threading or synchronization primitives) can vary on their input and
output of operations from platform to platform. For example, on Windows platforms you could use a
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686908%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" class="code">CRITICAL_SECTION</a>
to lock an area of code while on POSIX compliant systems (like Linux) you could use a
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread.h.html" class="code">pthread_mutex_t</a>.
The <code>pthread_mutex_t</code> is, by default, a non-recursive lock, so if the same thread were to call <code>lock</code> twice
in a row, a deadlock will occur and the application will hang. This differs from the <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code> which is re-entrant,
so a thread can call <code>lock</code> twice in a row without a deadlock. In this specific instance the
<a href="docs/classes/omni@@sync@@mutex.html" class="code">omni::sync::mutex</a>
ensures that the underlying mutex is a recursive mutex to not have a deadlock situation arise and have similar functionality across
platforms.<br><br>

Portions of Omni started before the C++11 standard was finalized, as such, one of the original design goals of Omni
was to have as much <i>"out of the box"</i> compatibility as possible with as many platforms and compilers as
could be deemed feasible. While the new standards do address some shortcomings of the previous standards libraries,
<i>"upgrade your compiler"</i> comes with a completely different set of issues to consider, especially in cross-platform
development.<br><br>

Caveats like these are what can cause build issues and slow downs in production when trying to target your software for multiple
platforms, and Omni can help alleviate these problems. Utilizing Omni and its deterministic classes and functions, you do not have to waste the extra time playing detective 
to port your application between systems and can be sure the similar concepts (like that of a thread or mutex) are similar across 
platforms, ensuring you are aware of the consequences of the code across all supported platforms!<br>
<a class="toppg" href="#topopage">top</a><br><br>

<font class="hdr">How did it start?</font><br>
The library spawned from an appreciation for events and delegates in .NET, a great appreciation for
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++ language</a> and a deep understanding of the gap
in functionally efficient cross platform programming constructs. Dissecting the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/gg145045%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">.NET Library Class Library</a>
and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/8bs2ecf4.aspx">Common Language Runtime (CLR)</a> (specifically
from a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/618ayhy6.aspx">C#</a> developers perspective) provided an ability
to take the idioms and 'ease of use' of languages like C# and Java and wrap the same contexts in a cross platform library,
making use of standards compliant C++ and any specific system API's needed.<br>
<a class="toppg" href="#topopage">top</a><br><br>

<font class="hdr">Where is it heading?</font><br>
Omni is designed to afford a user of the library more resources to develop while using less on design
overhead and maintenance. From the delegate and event system to the timers and threads, Omni has begun to
grow into a full cross platform library with the intentions to provide simple to implement C++ code.<br><br>
Currently the library is still in Beta while the documentation and base classes are ironed out and finalized.
Once the base classes have been vetted and thoroughly tested, goals for future development include databases,
various text parsers (like HTML and regular expressions), and user interface development.<br>
<a class="toppg" href="#topopage">top</a><br><br>

<font class="hdr">Why no pre-built libraries?</font><br>
Choosing to develop with C++ can be a daunting undertaking considering the wide array of platforms and
capabilities each support. Ensuring you have the right libraries and call the appropriate API for the
system you want affects more than just design decisions, it affects its re-usability, maintainability and
time to market to name just a few. While pre-compiled libraries are convenient, it can add an extra layer
of confusion in  the over all process.<br><br>
Including the full source in your project allows you the control of how your projects will be built, including
building your own 'Omni libraries' you can then customize and use as needed. You can visit the
<a href="docs/options/index.html">options</a> page for more details on how you can customize the library and you
can visit the <a href="docs/build/index.html">build</a> section for more on compiling the library. For more
information about which platforms are currently supported, you can visit the
<a href="xplat.html">cross platform</a> section.<br>
<a class="toppg" href="#topopage">top</a><br><br>

<a name="omni_license"></a><font class="hdr">Licensing</font><br>
Omni has a permissive free <a href="license.txt">license</a> which allows any user of the code to easily
integrate the library as part of their works. This license was chosen to allow greater flexibility in
how you see fit to use the code. Open source, closed source, government, finance, web, any area can easily
be subject to any number of other licenses or other legal confusion, we'd rather avoid that and give you
solid reusable code. We feel that Omni can help teach C++ by giving a familiar context to understand and
providing the source in an easy to use format; a budding engineer can pick up the code and gain a deeper
understanding for both C++ and system level programming. The license we've chosen helps us reach our goals
of enabling and educating, both our users and ourselves.<br>
