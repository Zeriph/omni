The Omni library can be compiled for many platforms including many Unix and Linux derivations and the Windows and Apple
lines of OS. Omni makes use of many OS specific API as well as standards conforming API's (like those in the C++ standard
library or in the POSIX.1c specification).<br><br>
Omni on Windows makes use of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff818516%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">WinAPI</a>.
For Unix and Linux variants, most API's used are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX.1c">
POSIX.1c</a> compliant and some are OS specific. For Apple platforms the POSIX.1c specification is used, as well as Unix
specific API's and depending on the library function, Apple specific C/C++ library functions will be used. For more
information on which API's are called throughout the library, visit the <a href="docs/api.html">API's</a> page.<br>
<br>
Part of the goal of the Omni library is to not have to guess what the function or class will do on different systems (i.e. we
want to ensure predictable and deterministic behaviour regardless of platform). As the library has morphed into what it is today,
there have been caveats and impasses down the road of cross platform compatibility. These issues affect certain design decisions and
Omni must make use of certain system level capabilities depending on what is being used or called to ensure proper determinism.
For instance, the <a href="docs/classes/omni@@sync@@mutex.html" class="code">omni::mutex</a> makes use of
of the <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code> type on Windows and the <code>pthread_mutex_t</code> type on other platforms.
The mutex object (specifically the <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code>) on a Windows platform is a recursive
lock by design whereas the POSIX code for the mutex object has to explicitly define if the mutex is to be recursive, that is,
code on POSIX systems will call <code>pthread_mutex_create</code> passing a <code>pthread_mutexattr_t</code> type with the
<code>PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE</code> defined so the underlying system mutex will be a recursive mutex. There are even certain
portions of code that have to be explicitly enabled (via compile time flags) due to their non-portable nature; 
<a href="docs/classes/omni@@system@@path.html" class="code">omni::system::path()</a> is an example of non-portable code.
Any source specific items worth bringing to attention (the <code>omni::mutex</code>, for instance) will be documented
and explained in the corresponding help and source documentation.<br><br>
The current version has been tested and works with the following platforms:<br>
<ul class="dot">
    <li>Windows (Windows 2000 and above)</li>
    <li>Apple OS X (kernel 10.4 and up)</li>
    <li>Sun Solaris (10+)</li>
    <li>Linux kernels 2.4 and above and Unix/BSD kernel bases:<br>
        Ubuntu 10.04, Fedora core 17, RHEL/CentOS 6.3, 
        Linux Mint 13, openSUSE 12.3, Slackware 14, 
        Debian 6.0.7, NetBSD 5.1.2, FreeBSD 9.1, 
        OpenBSD 5.1, PC-BSD 10, RoboLinux, QNX 6.4.0, 
        TurboLinux, ArchLinux, CoreOS, Gentoo, PCLinuxOS, 
        PuppyLinux, Mageia, Manjaro, ElementaryOS, Zorin
    </li>
</ul>
This list is not an exhaustive list of compatible platforms, it is merely a list of platforms we have tested against
due to their reasonable popularity as a distribution and due to time considerations (testing the compatibility of every
fork of a specific Linux/Unix kernel is no longer feasible in todays
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions">cornucopia of distributions</a>). If you do not see
your specific distribution in this list (or have an older version), there is still a very
likely chance the library will compile and run as expected on your platform; as with any 3rd party library or source, you
should always verify the tools being used against your needs.<br>
<br>
Please be aware if you are compiling for Windows in <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW/MSYS</a> or 
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> your code will be treated and compiled as a <code>POSIX</code>
platform and not as a Windows platform. It should be noted that the Windows pthread libraries are wrappers
for the appropriate WinAPI calls and certain code will output as if it were compiled for a Windows platform.<br>
<a class="toppg" href="#topopage">top</a><br><br>

<a name="how_we_test"></a><font class="hdr">Platform Testing</font><br>
To test a specific platform, a unit test was written utilizing the Omni library and it passed
if 3 conditions were met:
<ol>
    <li>The unit test compiled successfully with the Omni source and needed libraries (<code>-pthread</code> or <code>-rt</code> for instance).
    <li>The functionality of the unit test succeeds; the outcome of the test was as expected and without error.
    <li>The functionality of the unit test did not change the expected results on the platform being tested.
</ol>
The 3rd item being the most important in determination of final test status. If a test
was written and it compiled on all platforms and each platform successfully completed the test as
per the functional requirements (i.e. a mutex lock call should only return if it gets the lock), the
test is considered platform <i>safe</i>, meaning that the specific function can be compiled and used on
that specific system. If the test changes in any unexpected ways on a specific platform, research
is done to determine if that specific platform might need a tweak to the code (as can be the case with
certain Linux and Unix derivations). If a small tweak to the code can give the support needed and all 
tests have passed then the code is considered cross platform compatible. If the tests still fail or more
than a small tweak is needed (like extra functions) for a specific platform, that portion of code is
relegated to the <i>non-portable</i> section and annotated.<br>
<br>
Non-portable code does not necessarily mean that it will not work on your platform, it merely means that the output
cannot be determined to be the same across all platforms tested.<br>
<a class="toppg" href="#topopage">top</a><br><br>

<a name="embedded_support"></a><font class="hdr">Embedded support</font><br>
For Microsoft this is the WindowsCE and Windows Embedded line of OS, for Linux this includes any embedded Linux/Unix derivation.<br>
<br>
Embedded support cannot be guaranteed as not all system libraries are available among the many embedded environments. However
that does not preclude one from using Omni in an embedded environment. For a Microsoft build, the basic WinAPI set need be
available and a POSIX compliant environment for a Linux/Unix based build.

<!--An IP stack and the appropriate libraries to build against
will be needed if you intend on using the socket portions of the library.-->

If your environment does not support exception
handling (some Android platforms for example), you can specify the <a href="docs/options/omni_no_throw.html" class="code">OMNI_NO_THROW</a> 
preprocessor flag.<br>
<br>
For other preprocessor flags that might be useful for your platform (embedded or not), visit the <a href="docs/options/index.html">options</a> page.<br>
For system API calls that might affect your decision for using Omni in an embedded environment, see the <a href="docs/api.html">API's</a> page.<br>
<br>
Please note that the Omni library is an object oriented library; one of its priorities is to ensure as small a
footprint as feasible. That being said the Omni library can still be heavy in certain classes simply due
to object composition and inheritance. To this affect, there is the <a href="docs/options/omni_lite.html" class="code">OMNI_LITE</a> 
preprocessor define (<a href="docs/options/index.html">among others</a>) that can help slim down the library considerably, albeit at the cost of reduced
functionality in certain areas. Depending on your needs, reduced functionality may not actually inhibit your ability to take
full advantage of the Omni library; visiting the specific help page from the <a href="docs/classes/index.html">classes</a> portal
will give more information and other considerations to be taken.<br>
<a class="toppg" href="#topopage">top</a><br><br>

<a name="future_support"></a><font class="hdr">Future support</font><br>
When Omni was started, the C++11 standard had not be fully defined. The 
<a href="docs/classes/omni@@smart_ptr.html" class="code">omni::smart_ptr</a> is similar in function to the
C++11 <code>std::unique_ptr</code> and the <a href="docs/classes/omni@@sync@@thread.html" class="code">omni::sync::thread</a> object
could also make use of the <code>std::thread</code>, but because not all compilers and platforms support the new
extensions, Omni can be compiled with C++11 support by specifying the 
<a href="docs/options/omni_enable_cxx.html" class="code">OMNI_ENABLE_CXX</a> preprocessor flag.
This flag enables certain language extensions to be used in the Omni library instead of system specific API calls
as well it changes certain portions of code to handle the new extensions (like the `<code>= delete</code>` function modifier).<br>
<br>
The additional C++ specifications (14/17/20+) further extend/amend the C++11 standard, as such Omni aims to be a 
statically fluid library by allowing users to take advantage of the new C++ features if their compilers support it
via compile time flags. We chose to have a user specifically enable C++XX future support because the needs of everyone are 
different, and sometimes <i>upgrade your compiler/library</i> is not an answer; we want Omni to work for the developer, 
not the developer to work for Omni.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that only the functionality of the additional specifications that make sense to use in the library 
will be added via the compile times flags; like template extensions for certain portions of the code to make it easier
to utilize by the user. We will not add C++XX functionality to any internal code unless it can add a sufficient performance 
improvement; for example, while adding lambda's might make some portions of the internal function code easier to read, 
it does not improve the performance of said code.<br>
