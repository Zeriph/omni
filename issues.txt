The following is a list of known issues or action items for the current version
of the library and does not contain a chronological history (that is what the
git/svn histories are for). This list is like a "live" list meant to be more of
an all encompassing 'future' and 'todo' list noted and posted in the code repo.

Current version: 0.8.6

-The omni::net::socket/endpoint classes only support IP4 (no IP6/Unix yet).

-The date_time class is still being worked on (it does not parse dates/times yet)
