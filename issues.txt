The following is a list of known issues or action items for the current version
of the framework and does not contain a chronological history (that is what the
git/svn histories are for). This list is like a "live" list meant to be more of
an all encompassing 'future' and 'todo' list noted and posted in the code repo.

Current version: 0.8.0

-The datetime class is still being worked on.

-The omni::geometry::path namespace needs to be vetted and polished.

-The omni::math namespace needs a few functions vetted.

-The omni::net::socket/endpoint classes only support IP4 (no IP6/Unix yet).

-The I/O namespace has been tested and works with the majority of functions
but has not been fully vetted for functionality across platforms.

-need to update the framework with the following:
#if defined(OMNI_CHECK_ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW)
    if (omni::bits::will_addition_overflow(a,b)) { error }
#endif
NOTE: need to actually pay attention to this since this check needs to happen
BEFORE the error condition, so in instances where there are unary operations,
this won't necessarily work and will need to make the user aware in the docs.

-C++11 is not fully integrated
