The following is a list of known issues or action items for the current version
of the library and does not contain a chronological history (that is what the
git/svn histories are for). This list is like a "live" list meant to be more of
an all encompassing 'future' and 'todo' list noted and posted in the code repo.

Current version: 0.8.3

-A few current test of Debian in a VM no longer work as expected (even though
they previously did work). The tests build and run, but nothing is printed
regarding actual results, though some tests do run as expected.

-The omni::net::socket/endpoint classes only support IP4 (no IP6/Unix yet).

-The date_time class is still being worked on.

-The library does not account for arithmetic over/under-flow errors and
trusts the user of the code will do proper error handling above.
