The following is a list of known issues or action items for the current version
of the framework and does not contain a chronological history (that is what the
git/svn histories are for). This list is like a "live" list meant to be more of
an all encompassing 'future' and 'todo' list noted and posted in the code repo.

Current version: 0.8.2

-The date_time class is still being worked on.

-The math/geometry namespaces have not been fully tested

-The I/O namespace has been tested and works with the majority of functions
but has not been fully vetted for functionality across platforms.

-The omni::net::socket/endpoint classes only support IP4 (no IP6/Unix yet).

-The framework does not account for arithmetic over/under-flow errors and
trusts the user of the code will do proper error handling above.

-C++11 is not fully integrated
